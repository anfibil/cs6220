# CS6220 - Data Mining | _Summer 2018_

This repository contains supporting material to the Data Mining course being taught in the Summer of 2018 at the Seattle campus.  For the most part, the material you will find here is made up of Jupyter Notebooks that will be covered in class, and that illustrate Python implementations of some of the concepts we will discuss. Another set of notebook files will serve as reference for specific homework assignments, and those will be explicitly highlighted as such.

## The course Slack workspace

All communication/announcements related to the course will be done via Slack. As a registered student, you should have access to our slack group [here](https://cs6220summer2018.slack.com).
